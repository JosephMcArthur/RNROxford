## Funding Brief
Course grants (expected range $2000-$20000). Funds may be used to support the inclusion of neuroinformatics lectures in existing courses, support the video recording of existing neuroinformatics-related courses, and support the development of neuroinformatics-related training materials, as well as support the holding of in-person courses and hackathons.
### Collaborating team
*Give a brief description (1000 characters including spaces) of the team which will arrange this course, including their national and institutional affiliations. If possible, also list the intended speakers or invitees, including affiliations. This will help the reviewers to evaluate whether this team can realistically manage to hold the proposed course in the given time schedule, how international collaborations are being leveraged, and how this may establish new connections within the community.*


Alex Morley is a DPhil student at the MRC Brain Network Dynamic Unit in the University of Oxford, a Software-Carpentry Instructor and an active member of the Mozilla Science community. Matthew South, a software engineer at the Oxford centre for Human Brain Activity and trainee Software-Carpentry instructor, will be helping with the workshops and providing his expertise in human-based research. The proposed workshop has the support of the UK Neuroinformatics node.

### Course title
**Introduction to Reproducible Research for Neuroscience**

### Abstract (public, if awarded)
*In 1500 characters (including spaces), provide an abstract of your proposed course theme and goals. Please focus on what you will deliver and how, and what its impact on the field will be. Briefly describe the relevance of the course for training in neuroscience and neuroinformatics. Remember that this summary will be used as a ‘public abstract’ so please refrain from including any confidential information that you do not want to share globally.*


This workshop will provide a practical introduction to reproducible research practices and their application within neuroscience. It’s key aims are outreach - exposing more scientists to the key concepts in reproducible research, training - providing basic training in one of those concepts, and longevity -to introduce resources for further learning. The workshop will thus be split into two parts. The first part will consist of a set of talks from leaders in their fields introducing and discussing a few key concepts such as the current issues with reproducibility in neuroscience, open publication, reproducible analysis workflows and using open data platforms. These talks will highlight not only why changes in current practice are necessary but also how they can be directly beneficial to the scientists who take part. The second will be a set of break-out workshops that provide basic training in one particular area. Example workshop titles include “Git & Github: how to organise and share your code.”, “Best practices in scientific programming” and “Open-data: how, when and where to share your data”. While some new resources may be created for these workshops they will primarily consist of existing work that has been adapted to make it accessible and relevant to a neuroscience audience. Finally, they will be collated along with video recordings of the talks and hosted together in a publicly accessible repository/website.

### Outcomes
Reproducible Research: Why can’t we just carry on as we were?
Open Data: What is is Open Data and why is it beneficial? Can I share my data and how should I do it? Finding & using other people’s data.
Code Sharing & Version Control: What is version control and why should I use it? How does git work? (Why) should I share my code on Github?
Best practices in Scientific Programming: Making your code readable. Stacks and workspaces.
What pre-prints and registered reports can do for reproducibility.

### Relevance for neuroscience and neuroinformatics communities
*In 1500 characters (including spaces), explain how this course will help advance training in the field. Why is it important to hold this course now? How will the knowledge gained and/or transferred in this course benefit and drive forward the neuroinformatics and/or neuroscience communities? How does the course align with INCF’s mission and strategic objectives?*


Many funding bodies and journals are currently, or are on the verge of, taking measures to improve the reproducibility and generalisability of neuroscience research such as requiring scientists to share their code and/or data. However many scientists feel that they do not yet have the skills or time to enact these policies. The core aims of this workshop are to persuade scientists that training in these skills is time well-invested and showcase how this training can be made accessible to all who need it. Empowering a community of neuro-biologists to share their data gives their experiments the chance to have a greater impact, and provides invaluable resources for neuro-informaticians. The repository created at the end of the course will answer the question “How do I get started with making my neuroscience more reproducible?”. This, we believe, is where there is currently a gap in training resources, and the one we aim to fill. 

### Budget
*You can only enter numbers into this field. Between 2000 USD and 20 000 USD is available per grant but we ask that you be as specific as possible with your budget.*
$4000

### Justification
*Under justification it is sufficient to just write the types of costs and the amounts. Provide enough information so the reviewer can judge whether this is important for the course. Please state any other funding that may contribute to this course at this time or during its future development.*
